issue : it seems it is not checking the 









colored_buttons = [i for i in frame.grid_slaves() if i["bg"]==color]

#print("secopnd time here should be the prevbioud button", colored_buttons)

all_colored = [i["text"] for i in frame.grid_slaves() if i["bg"] in colors]


when called i get the different coordinates of teh pressed buttons, 
colored buttons (color of teh single ship) , 
all_colored (other ships),
total_ships (total number of ships to place)










possible_actions =  calculate_cases(x, y,colored_buttons, all_colored, total_ships) 

all_y is not working, goes through the other lists and doesn t enter the correct column when needed 





calculate cases(x, y,colored_buttons_singular, all_colored, total_ships)
                checkig_first_button(trying_x, trying_y, x, y,all_x, all_y)
                avoiding_skipping_rows(input_x)
                                        checking_lines()
                                        most_frequent(List)
